BuildJS
=======

BuildJS is a simple [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based build tool for static web
apps, Google Chrome extensions etc. It parses a directory structure, runs checks
and compilations/minifications on JavaScript and CSS files and finally creates a
packaged version of the web app in an output directory while the source contents
stays untouched.
